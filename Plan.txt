Charater:
Import an already-built rpg character from Unity store.
need the following attributes for now:
		- hp, atk, ap, armor, magicResist, moveSpeed, range
	- Navigation:
			- will use navmesh
	- Interaction with turrets and minions:
			- can damage them within a certain range

Environment:
will use a simple plane to begin with, adding turrets and terrains such as walls
	- turrets:
		- will see if I could get something from the store for free, otherwise a simple cube with a red cube on top will do
		- turrets will have the detection method running every frame, to determine whether it shoots.
			 - the detection method will be done using collider triggers (isTrigger).
			 - prioritize minions over champions, with a condition to trigger aggro from champions
		- turret shots will be done using thr particle system.

Minions:
will use simple cubes to represent them, and their attacks will be done using the particle system.
they will start spawning at a particular time and then spawn periodically.
